# hashtag-generator
This is a simple Instagram hashtag generator made with Excel and VBA. Nothing fancy. Use my set of hashtags or make one yourself.


Sheets:

- Selective Hashtag Generator

    Skip through the set of hashtags and add the one you like to the list. Copy and Paste them to where ever you need them.
    Macros have to be active in order to work properly.

- Bulk Hashtag Generator

    After clicking the button "Reload Hashtags" a list of 30 random Hashtags will be generated for you. Do this until you like most of the hashtags.
    You can finetune the generated list afterwards if you like.
    Hashtags generated more than once are coloured orange.
    Works without Macros:
    
    "Reload Hashtags" -> Ctrl + R
    
    "Copy Hashtags" -> Ctrl + C (after selecting Cell B35)

- Bulk Hashtag Generator

    Column "Hashtags" is used in Sheet "Bulk Generator"
    Column "Hashtags-for-Selective" is used in Sheet "Selective Generator"
    
    
    Note: After going through the sets and deleting hashtags you dont like, select the column and press _Data_ > _Remove Dublicates_. This is going to remove the empty cells in between.
